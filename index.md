#Rawcopy

##About
Rawcopy is an R package for processing of Affymetrix CytoScan HD, CytoScan 750k and SNP 6.0 microarrays for copy number analysis. It takes CEL files (raw microarray intensity values) as input. Output consists of: 

<b>Log ratio</b>: normalized intensity per probe relative to sample median and a reference data set

<b>B-allele frequency or BAF</b>: estimated abundance of the B allele relative to total abundance, SNP probes only

<b>Segments</b>: genomic segments of unchanging copy number, estimated using the PSCBS package

<b>Figures</b>: several figures per sample and sample set are plotted for the user's convenience, some examples are shown below
